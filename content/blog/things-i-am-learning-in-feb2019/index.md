In January this year, I developed a new technique to keep track of what I learn. I call it ***count by week***, I will post an article on that soon. 5 weeks of this year have passed, today we are in 2nd day of 6th week. In coming weeks of Feburary, I will be learning back-end web development in JavaScript. The stack will consist of **Express.js**, **Mongoose**, **Pug** and various node packages and libraries.

### What will I be learning?
For past year I have been coding for front-end and some small side projects in NodeJS and Python. However I have not invested time in learning back-end web development, I was making and breaking plans for it. Finally in January of this year, I finished my pending front-end projects and made a decision to learn back-end. And since my brain was already charged with JavaScript, I chose NodeJS.

### What course have I selected?
There are a lot of great courses for Express(*NodeJS framework*) on web, some of them are free. But I always choose video tutorials which are interactive and are backed by community. I read the name [wesbos](https://wesbos.com/) a lot on twitter, he is popular for his web development courses. I went for his *Learn Node* course, he teaches everything from scratch with Express, Pug and Mongo. This course is perfect in terms of what I was looking for, however one downfall is that it is from 2017 and not updated since. Wesbos also give the access to his official slack channel so if I am stuck, I can get help instantly. 

### How am I going to approach it?
In past 3 weeks I have watched 16 videos from this course, learning experience is good. I am also self-learning things in Express, because despite how many assigned task you complete, *you cannot experience the challenges of creating something from scratch if you do not work with core library and API*. Express is a minimal NodeJS framework and have an excellent documentation. Pug is a JavaScript templating engine that is popular for its use with Express. And, finally MongoDB, Mongoose is a nodejs package that is used to operate MongoDB. Working with these three stacks majorly and throwing in CSS, I will also be making my own project parallel to tutorial. In this way, I can learn CSS grid as well.

### Conclusion
To sum up, I am going to learn Express, Pug, Mongoose and other packages to build back-end websites. With this course, I will also focus on debugging problems that occur due to old dependencies in wesbos's boiler project. Feburary is packed with back-end, it will be hard to resist the temptation of doing some projects with *React* and *Gatsby*, but I'll try my best 😋.
